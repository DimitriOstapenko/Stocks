The agriculture tax questions facing the marijuana industry are the latest wrinkle for the states flouting federal drug law and trying to establish commercial recreational pot industries. The states have settled how to tax marijuana once it&#39;s dried and ready to smoke. But they&#39;re still debating how to tax it while it&#39;s growing. (AP Photo /Ed Andrieski)' height='259' alt='Marijuana Taxes' width='460' src='http://i.cbc.ca/1.2536520.1392338391!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_460/marijuana-taxes.jpg' /> <p>Canadians used to be pretty smug about how progressive they were compared to the U.S., Neil Macdonald writes.

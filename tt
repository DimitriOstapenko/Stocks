1. "Socialism isn't the opposite of individualism.."

Socialism is exactly opposite of individualism.  "a theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole."  In USSR we were expected to act, think and dress according to GROUP norms. ANY expression of individuality or belief in anything other than GROUP was severely punished. People were uniformly miserable standing in long lines for everything. Yes we had free healthcare, education, almost free transportation and housing, but people had to wait for years to get tiny apartment and everybody was making same amount of money equal approximately to 10 dollars a month. I'm not making this up. I lived in it for 35 years.

2. "Long before capitalism, nearly every society was based around the group, not individuals. And in most cases, people still exchanged the currency they earned for goods and services." 

Wrong again. None of the societies before capitalism exchanged currency for goods and services. Look up definitionof feudalism for example.

3. "If we want to know how well capitalism is doing - in the US there are currently more empty houses than homeless people. The system is going to fail. "

Yes US is failing as we speak and exactly because of giant socialist experiment there. Under Obama number of people on food stamps doubled and the debt skyrocketed. "Free" healthcare which is nothing but a huge tax and added inefficiency in the system, huge scary government that became total control freak soviet/fascist german style, is destroying what was the most successful society in human history - society based on free market, free exchange of ideas, freedom of speech and belief, which is capitalism.

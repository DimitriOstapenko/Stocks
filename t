I know many people in my neighborhood, most are friendly and nice. I talk with a mail man, neighbors, people in the street, dog owners daily. I chat with nice old cleaning lady, Virginia in local grocery store, with most swimmers in our swimming pool and know them by name. Buying experience? I speak with cashiers all the time. 

I think there is sense of community here just like in most other places around the world. It's just a matter of wether you like this particular community or not. The choice is personal. And, of course, after living for years outside of Canada it's only natural that you loose connections here and gain them in a new place. 

As far as individualism, thank God that western society is based on it. I know the alternative first hand and wouldn't wish to anyone to experience it. Not one socialist experiment ever ended well. As Orwell well put it "socialism is equal distribution of misery, capitalism is unequal distribution of bliss".
